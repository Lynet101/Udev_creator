# Udev_creator
Simple program for creating udev rules for linux (also compatible with NixOS)

Scans Connected USB devices, and allows the user to select a device, along with a permission level (0664, or 0666) to automatically create the rule


PS:
This is early, early dev. This means that the code is messy as F### cause I'm just figuring out the steps involved... The program will likely be rewritten in c further down the line
